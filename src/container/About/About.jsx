          Iâ€™m a Software Developer with a passion for building scalable and
          high-performance applications that deliver exceptional user
          experiences. With expertise in <strong>React.js</strong>, <strong>Node.js</strong>, and <strong>Django Rest
          Framework</strong>, I specialize in developing B2B e-commerce platforms,
          crafting intuitive UI/UX components, and designing robust APIs that
          drive seamless data flow and real-time communication. I have hands-on
          experience working with <strong>MongoDB</strong> and <strong>MySQL</strong>, efficiently managing and
          optimizing databases for performance and scalability. On the backend,
          I architect <strong>RESTful APIs</strong>, implement real-time WebSocket features, and
          ensure smooth integration between frontend and backend services. I
          thrive in agile development environments, leading sprints, managing
          tasks with <strong>Jira</strong> and <strong>Monday</strong>, and ensuring on-time project delivery. I
          also enjoy mentoring junior developers, conducting thorough code
          reviews, and implementing best practices for maintainability and
          performance optimization. As a technology enthusiast, I constantly
          explore new tools and frameworks to push the boundaries of innovation
          and deliver cutting-edge solutions.
